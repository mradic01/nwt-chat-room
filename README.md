# NWT - Chat Room Application with Socket.io

This project provides a fully implemented server and frontend for a chat room application. Students will also have access to [resources](https://fesb-nwt.netlify.app/docs/Sockets/Kreiranje%20Strukture/) for the frontend, which is nearly complete but includes a few additional tasks for completion.

## Exercise Overview

While I strive to design exercises that are lightweight and can be set up within 5 minutes, this exercise required a prebuilt server to demonstrate the real capabilities of Socket.io.

In this exercise, students will focus on building a **simple chat room application** by following straightforward instructions provided in the [Instructions](https://fesb-nwt.netlify.app/docs/Sockets/Kreiranje%20Strukture/).

This hands-on experience is an excellent opportunity for students to grasp the fundamentals of sockets and real-time communication in web applications.
